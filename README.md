# ayatori

**STATUS**: Pre-alpha, in design and prototyping phase.

ayatori is an experimental LRA (Long Running Action) Coordinator and client libraries that try to follow (not completely) [Eclipse Microprofile LRA Spec](https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-lra-1.0/microprofile-lra-spec-1.0.html). 



Of course, It is not ready for production usage, yet :)


## TODO

- [ ] more Microprofile LRA Spec features
- [ ] stabilize the api
- [ ] write more test, test, test
